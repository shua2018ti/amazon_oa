(1) find a short path in a matrix for delivering package from (0,0) to the destination which has value 9. 
In the matrix value 0 means it is not accessible, value 1 means it is accessible.
I solved with typecial BFS search which counts the levels searched.

(2) Search a given length K string in a string array but leave out these that has repeated chars, i.e: the result only 
contains non-repeated chars K-length strings.
I solved it with two pointers using hash set to filter repeated strings. And Then count the result string and remove 
the ones that has repeated chars (by counting using hash map)
